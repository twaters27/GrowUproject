I'm the project coordinator.

My responsibilities are to make sure everyone is helping in some way or another and things are progressing well.

Today I worked with my team to make our github and shared repo, as well as make a google space for communication 
and a figma group to create a mockup.

My biggest challenge was get to know the people of my new group.

My goals are to do as much as I can for the group and complete as much as the rubrick asks us for.

I will continue the mockup on figma.

A new challenge that arose today is that we are still very lost!

One resource that I'm using to help me out is W3 schools

One resource I'm using to collaborate better with my teams is google chats!
