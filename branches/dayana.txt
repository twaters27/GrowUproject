Test from Dayana!

# 10/1/24

I'm the project coordinator.

My responsibilities are to make sure everyone is helping in some way or another and things are progressing well.

Today I worked with my team to make our github and shared repo, as well as make a google space for communication 
and a figma group to create a mockup.

My biggest challenge was get to know the people of my new group.

My goals are to do as much as I can for the group and complete as much as the rubrick asks us for.

I will continue the mockup on figma.

A new challenge that arose today is that we are still very lost!

One resource that I'm using to help me out is W3 schools.

One resource I'm using to collaborate better with my teams is google chats!

I'm not sure if it's my full effort, but I'm definetly trying.

I hope to improve the site by getting the sign/log in page complete by the end of the week.

A techincal challenge is that git struggles are still here and I'm personally not the greatest at Javascript ;(

A way I can support my team is by minimizing my mistakes. :D !!!

One idea I had to revisit from last year was my end of the year project productify that was alos a health and fitness tracker

I have not used a real world site or references for my project that aren't past projects.

I have not taken any of that into account.
