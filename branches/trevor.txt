My role is backend developer.

My responsibiliies are the back end of the project, 90% of it being in the server and js files.

I mainly worked on planning what the webiste would look like, worked on some of the index.js file, and helped my teammates get their git and local files set up.

The biggest challeenge today was getting everyone set up with their local files as we all had to make tokens and git clone into our files.

My goals for the project are to have a fully functional webpage(s) with 0 errors in the code.

I will mainly work on getting the index.js file set up, so that my teammates can see their webpages and work on them without having to do it blindy.
